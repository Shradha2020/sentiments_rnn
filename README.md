**Abstract**

The expansion of internet and freedom of speech has allowed users to express and disseminate information in various ways. Sentiment analysis is the automated process to determine the author's attitude, emotion or evaluation on certain topics. It can be used by companies for social media monitoring, brand monitoring, product analysis, analyzing customer feedback and reacting accordingly etc. This repo explores Sentiment analysis by using the IMDB movie review dataset to build sentiment classifier which will predict if the given review is positive or negative. The classifiers are built on traditional Machine Learning Algorithms, Recurrent Neural networks like GRU, LSTM and Bi-LSTMs and pre trained BERT model. The experiment demonstrated that deep learning models outperformed machine learning models. This experiment can be conducted on any review dataset.




**DataSet** 

The sentiment dataset consists of 50K movie reviews and is provided by https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/ for performing binary sentiment classification.Each sample in the dataset has two columns, the text of the review and the corresponding sentiment (positive or negative) of the text.The dataset is almost balanced and has around the same number of positive and negative reviews.
